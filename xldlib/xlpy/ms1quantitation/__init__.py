    XlPy/MS1Quantitation
    ____________________

    Tools for calculating spectral masses from theoretical isotope
    mod profiles, extracting the ion chromatograms, and formatting
    the data sets for further analysis.

    This is an MS1-level quantitation, that is, it extracts a profile
    from the Full MS scans to generate an extracted ion chromatogram.
